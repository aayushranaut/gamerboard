## GamerBoard API
*******************
Gamerboard API is an attempt to scrap users publicly available data from PlayStation Network. The [CronController](https://github.com/aayushranaut/gamerboard/blob/master/app/controllers/CronController.php) class contains the method, which I've used to scrap data from PSN.
The API for returning specific PSN users and the scrapping of data is almost ready. You have to only connect the functions and write some unit tests.

##Disclaimer
*******************
I do not support scrapping data from PSN API. Anyone using this software should use it at his own risk.
